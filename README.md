This is the package manager used for Tres Framework. This is a stand-alone 
package, which means that it can be used without the framework.

This package manager allows you to autoload classes from different directories.

## Requirements

For examples, please see [this](examples/index.php) along with its 
[manifest](examples/manifest.php).
